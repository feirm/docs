# Introduction to Feirm

Welcome! Feirm is a blockchain project that develops privacy respecting applications. As a project, we feel very strongly about privacy, decentralisation and security throughout our applications.

The entire Feirm project is made up from two components at the moment:

- Blockchain
- Kayda Service Layer

The network is powered by the Feirm blockchain. It is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network which allows users to transact instantly and with small fees. Additionally, the network is secured with [Service Nodes](#), which provide additional decentralised services to the network.

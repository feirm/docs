# Overview

Feirm has been able to develop and use decentralised components to build our platforms. This amount of scalability and flexibility has been enabled by a set of incentivised nodes called Service Nodes which operate on a network we like to call Kayda. We also refer to this as our service layer.

In order to run a Kayda Node, an operator ideally needs two pieces of software:
* Feirm Cryptocurrency Daemon
* Kayda Service Layer Daemon

Both pieces of software can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/feirm).

Once Kayda is marked for a stable release and ready for integration with the Feirm cryptocurrency network, a node operator will lock a signficant amount of the Feirm cryptocurrency for a period of time and provide a set of services embedded into the Kayda daemon for the network. For the services the node providers, the operator will be compensated for the use of their hardware on the network.

At the time of writing, the only service provided by the Kayda network is textual data storage.

# Running a Kayda Node

At this moment in time, users are able to operate a Kayda Node on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It is platform agnostic. Whilst compatability is great throughout these operating systems at the moment, there will become a point where services a Kayda node offers would simply be too ineffecient for operating systems such as Windows.

Additionally, the Kayda network is separate from the Feirm cryptocurrency network. We like to think of this as a multi-tiered network design where Kayda simply acts as an overlay to the existing Feirm cryptocurrency network. We also feel that this encourages more decentralisation and flexibility as Kayda is not confined to the restrictions of the Feirm cryptocurrency network where speed and availability of nodes is concerned.

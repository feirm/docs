# Overview

Feirm has been able to develop and use decentralised components to build our platforms. This amount of scalability and flexibility has been enabled by a set of incentivised nodes called Service Nodes. In order to run a Service Node, an operator locks a signficant amount of the Feirm cryptocurrency for a period of time and provide a set of services to the network. At the moment, the only service provided by Service Nodes is message storage. In return for the services they provide, the operator is receives a portion of the block reward from each block.

By making use of our existing network of Service Nodes, we become resistant to Sybil attacks. In order to execute and attack against the Service Nodes, the attacker would need a large amount of the Feirm cryptocurrency. Based on the principles of supply and demand, the supply of Feirm would increase and in turn cause the demand to increase, ultimately making it more expensive to execute an attack. To make sure that the Feirm network can remain protected from such attack, a dynamic reward scheme has been set so the reward changes over time.

# Setting up a Feirm Service Node

At this moment in time, users are able to configure a Service Node on Windows and Linux. MacOS can be used, but it is not advised to do so as the support is primarily focused for the first two systems. There will become a point in time though, where due to the requirements of a Service Node, it will have to be operated from a Linux server/machine.

# Feirm Service Node Activities

Currently, Feirm Service Nodes act as full nodes on the Feirm network. They only become Service Nodes when the owner locks a certain of the Feirm cryptocurrency to act as a collateral in the form of a transaction. Once this transaction is validated by other nodes on the network, the owner of the Service Node can start to earn a portion of the block reward.

It should be noted that the core functionalities of a Feirm Service Node is basic right now. The software is constantly changing, meaning operators need to remain up to date with any updates. Once we push all of the updates in the future, you can expect a Service Node to offer the following services:

* Governance (budget proposals and voting)
* Data storage (textual)

Due to the nature of some of these services, there will be a need for better servers, especially when it comes to the amount of bandwidth.

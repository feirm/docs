Service Nodes that are operating on the Feirm Network will be expected to require the following:

* Data storage.

## Data Storage
Service Nodes are expected to operate the Feirm Service Layer Daemon - the application which is deployed on top of each existing Feirm full-node and allows more functionality on the network. There is a crucial need for textual data storage when it comes to applications such as the Feirm Marketplace and Feirm Messenger. The data for these applications will eventually be stored on the distributed Service Layer network.
